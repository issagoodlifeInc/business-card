## My process

Not that complicated did the Info first then the About and Interests
which are pretty similar and finally the footer
A whole headache to use [Fontawesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/react/) for the first time with React works well though üí™üèΩ

### Built with

- React
- JSX syntax
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Intergrating FontAwesome with React

- Creating a React-App using npm

- Using Figma files to code

- React! React! React!

### Continued development

- Learning more React! (yeah reenacting React problems and tackling them)

- Better turnaround time -- simple stuff but worked on it for a while

- Less Code (code cleanup)
